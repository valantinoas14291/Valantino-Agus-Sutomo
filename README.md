I am interested to learn more about Data Science. I had strong background in mathematics and statistics (bachelor and master degree), combined with actuarial studies to develop my skill in data science especially predictive modelling analysis. I am expert in Matlab, and R, but upper intermediate in Python. I open to collaborate in some project related to data science.
